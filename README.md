## Techniques
### Possible approaches to a behavior change program:
1. Hand-holding
    * Hand-holding on the way to begin the night-time prep duties is a nice setting event to get the behavior requested.
2. Mentioning points
    * Mentioning the ability to earn points in the prompt is a good setting event
3. Using effusive praise
    * Using effusive praise – specific, enthusiasm, affectionate touch – for completing the behaviors
4. Immediately awarding a point
    * Immediately awarding a point after backpack behavior done is a good way to lock in the good behavior
5. Giving a choice
    * Giving a choice in between backpack step and getting the clothes step
6. Addjing a challenge
    * Adding a challenge by noting that the getting the clothes step “might be too hard”
7. Adjusting the program
    * Adjusting the program to reward doing separate behaviors in succession
8. Praising partial completion
    * Praising partial completion. Praise for approximations of the behavior is important for shaping.  Praise for trying and for partial success are also good.

### Negotiation with adolescents
* Select a good time where there is no tension and no decision has to be reached at this moment
* Listen without jumping in
* Be respectful of the teen (no scoffing or saying  “that’s a dumb suggestion”)
* Focus on the present (avoid bringing up what teen did in the past)
* Stay on the subject/topic (in this case, cell phone use)
* Offer possible suggestions when there is disagreement
